      <h2>Virat Kohli</h2>
      <p>
        Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation ʋɪɾɑʈ koɦli; born 5 November 1988) is
        an Indian international cricketer and the former captain of the Indian
        national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional
        medium-fast bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru
        in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli is widely regarded as
        one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He holds the record as the
        highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as
        the fourth-highest in international cricket. He also holds the record
        for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the
        list of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a member of the
        Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 ICC Champions
        Trophy, and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive
        times in 2017, 2018, and 2019. <br />

        In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI
        batsmen. In 2015, he achieved the summit of T20I rankings. In 2018, he
        was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to
        hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the
        first player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the
        International Cricket Council named him the male cricketer of the decade
        <br />

        He has received many accolades for his performances in cricket. He won
        the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and
        2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC
        Cricketer of the Year, on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively.
        In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player
        of the Year awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden
        Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to
        2018. At the national level, Kohli was honoured with the Arjuna Award in
        2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the
        Khel Ratna award, in 2018. <br />

        In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most
        influential people in the world. Kohli has been deemed one of the most
        commercially viable athletes, with estimated earnings of ₹634 crore
        (US$79 million) in the year 2022.
        <br />
        Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu
        family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and
        his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother,
        Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna. Kohli's formative years were spent
        in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public
        School. According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for
        cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat,
        display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him. <br />

        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of
        that year, Prem Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for
        cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him
        to meet Rajkumar Sharma. Upon the suggestion of their neighbours,
        Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket
        academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more
        than just playing in gully cricket.[12] Despite his abilities, he faced
        the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi
        team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly
        received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would
        have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli
        eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team. He received
        training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at
        the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave. In pursuit of
        furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent
        School during his ninth-grade education. <br />

        On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a
        cerebral attack. During his childhood, his father played a crucial role
        in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the
        one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings
        of missing his father's presence at times. According to his mother,
        Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took
        cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and
        dedicating himself fully to the sport.[12] Kohli's family resided in
        Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they
        relocated to Gurgaon.<br />

        Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical
        abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour. His customarily batting
        position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested
        stance, and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been
        noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his
        propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in
        high-pressure situations. In his batting technique, Kohli tends to
        favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is
        appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent
        prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region.<br />

        Kohli playing his famous flick shot at the 2015 Cricket World Cup Kohli
        has often expressed his admiration for the cover drive, which he
        considers to be his signature stroke. He possesses a natural aptitude
        for the flick shot, particularly when facing deliveries aimed towards
        leg stump. Having a limited recourse to the sweep shot, Kohli's batting
        technique is characterized by an emphasis on ground shots that primarily
        yield runs in the regions between deep square leg and mid-on. Kohli is
        known for his composed batting technique and versatility in his play. He
        scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also
        possessing the ability to display a destructive streak. His combination
        of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft innovative
        angles that disrupt traditional field positioning. Kohli is also a
        proficient fielder, recognized for his quick reflexes and
        sure-handedness.<br />

        However, Kohli has a known vulnerability to deliveries that are wide of
        the off-stump. Bowlers often exploit this weakness by targeting him with
        such deliveries, especially in Test and ODl matches. This vulnerability
        has resulted in Kohli's dismissal on numerous occasions. Cricket experts
        such as VVS Laxman and former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar have
        acknowledged this weakness, and former New Zealand cricketer Richard
        Hadlee has also noted that Kohli is particularly susceptible to
        out-swinging deliveries.<br />

        Kohli has garnered widespread acclaim and recognition as a preeminent
        limited-overs batsman by cricketing experts and aficionados alike. In
        ODIs, he boasts an average of 65.5 runs when batting second and 51.7
        runs when batting first. He has amassed 27 of his 50 ODI hundreds in
        run-chases, and holds the record for the most hundreds scored when
        batting second. In reference to his success while batting second, Kohli
        has expressed a fondness for the challenge of chasing, relishing the
        opportunity to test himself and demonstrate his ability to efficiently
        manage strike rotation and execute boundary hits.[50] His colleagues
        admire his self-assurance, dedication, concentration, and work ethic,
        which are the driving forces behind his success.<br />

        Champions League T20 titles in 2010 and 2014. He is amongst the few
        batsmen to have scored more than five thousand runs in the IPL, as well
        as being the first wicket-keeper to do so. In 2008, Dhoni was awarded
        India's highest sport honor Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award by
        Government of India. He received the fourth highest civilian award Padma
        Shri in 2009 and third highest civilian award Padma Bhushan in 2018.

      <h2>Rohit Sharma</h2>

      <p>
        Rohit Gurunath Sharma (born 30 April 1987) is an Indian international
        cricketer who currently captains the India national cricket team across
        all formats. He is a right-handed batsman. Considered one of the best
        batsmen of his generation and one of the greatest opening batters of all
        time, Sharma is known for his timing, elegance, six-hitting abilities
        and leadership skills. Sharma holds several batting records which
        famously include most sixes in international cricket,[a] most double
        centuries in ODI cricket (3), most centuries at Cricket World Cups (7)
        and joint most hundreds in Twenty20 Internationals (5). Rohit Sharma is
        the first player to score 5 T20I centuries. He plays for Mumbai Indians
        in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket.<br />

        Sharma formerly captained Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles
        in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 under his leadership, making him the
        most successful captain in IPL history, sharing this record with MS
        Dhoni (5 title wins in IPL). With India, Sharma was a member of the team
        that won the 2007 T20 World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy,
        where he played in the finals of both tournaments. Rohit is one of four
        players to have played in every edition of the ICC T20 World Cup, from
        the inaugural edition in 2007 to the latest one in 2022.<br />

        Sharma currently holds the world record for the highest individual score
        (264) in a One Day International (ODI) match and is the only player to
        have scored three double-centuries in ODIs and also holds the record for
        scoring most hundreds (five) in a single Cricket World Cup, for which he
        won the ICC Men's ODI Cricketer of the Year award in 2019. Sharma has
        received two national honours, the Arjuna Award in 2015 and the
        prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award in 2020 by the Government
        of India. Under his captaincy, India won the 2018 Asia Cup and the 2023
        Asia Cup, the seventh and eighth time the country won the title, both in
        ODI format as well as the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, their second overall and
        first in T20I format.<br />

        Outside cricket, Sharma is an active supporter of animal welfare
        campaigns. He is the official Rhino Ambassador for WWF-India and is a
        member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). He has
        worked with PETA in its campaign to raise awareness of the plight of
        homeless cats and dogs in India.<br />
        In November 2013, during Sachin Tendulkar's farewell series, Sharma made
        his Test debut at Eden Gardens in Kolkata against West Indies and scored
        177, the second-highest score on debut by an Indian to Shikhar Dhawan
        (187). He followed it up with 111 (not out) in the second Test at his
        home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.<br />

        Having been out of the Test team since 2017–18, Sharma went on the
        2018–19 tour of Australia after he had earned a recall earlier. Chief
        selector M. S. K. Prasad said the reason for his recall was that his
        natural game suited the bouncy Australian pitches.[27] Sharma played in
        the first Test in Adelaide, scoring 37 and 1 in an Indian
        victory.[28][29] During the first Test, he sustained a minor injury
        which saw him miss the second Test in Perth.[30] He recovered for the
        Boxing Day third Test at Melbourne and scored 63 (not out) to help India
        total 443/7 and win both the Test and the series.[31] After the third
        Test, Sharma had to return to India for the birth of his daughter.<br />

        In October 2019, in the third Test against South Africa, Sharma scored
        his 2,000th run and his first double century in Tests. He made 212 in
        the first innings of the match.[33][34] Sharma was named as vice-captain
        of India's Test team during the tour of Australia in 2020, replacing
        Cheteshwar Pujara.<br />

        Sharma had a successful home series against England in 2021.
        Instrumental in his team's comeback after a defeat in the first Test at
        Chennai, he scored a century, one that The Guardian termed "deserves to
        be considered one of the greatest this century." He put on 167 runs with
        Ajinkya Rahane for the fourth wicket while making 161 runs in an innings
        that included 18 fours and two sixes. India went on to win the Test by
        317 runs. He top-scored for his side in both innings of the low-scoring
        third Test in Ahmedabad with scores of 66 and 25 contributing to his
        team's win. Sharma finished the series aggregating 345 runs, the most
        for India, at an average of 58. He went on to score his first overseas
        Test century on 4 September 2021 with an innings of 127 against England
        at The Oval, also reaching the milestone of 3,000 runs in Test
        cricket.<br />

        Sharma was appointed captain of India's Test team in February 2022,
        succeeding Virat Kohli, ahead of a two-match series against Sri
        Lanka.[43] Sunil Gavaskar praised his leadership and Chetan Sharma,
        India's chairman of selectors, said: "We will groom future captains
        under him". <br /><br />

      <h2>Sachin Tendulkar</h2>

      <p>
        Sachin Tendulkar, (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ ⓘ; pronounced [sətɕin
        teːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international
        cricketer who captained the Indian national team. He is widely regarded
        as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] Hailed as
        the world's most prolific batsman of all time, he is the all-time
        highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000
        runs and 15,000 runs, respectively. He also holds the record for
        receiving the most player of the match awards in international cricket.
        Tendulkar was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by nomination from
        2012 to 2018.<br />

        Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match
        debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of
        sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India
        internationally for over 24 years.[9] In 2002, halfway through his
        career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time,
        behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time,
        behind Viv Richards.[10] The same year, Tendulkar was a part of the team
        that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy.
        Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the
        2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for
        India. He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the
        2003 World Cup.<br />

        Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India: the
        Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998),
        and the Padma Vibhushan (2008). After Tendulkar played his last match in
        November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to
        award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He was the
        first sportsperson to receive the reward and, as of 2023, is the
        youngest recipient. In 2010, Time included Tendulkar in its annual list
        of the most influential people in the world. Tendulkar was awarded the
        Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010
        International Cricket Council (ICC) Awards.<br />

        Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012, he retired from all forms of
        cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match. Tendulkar
        played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.
        In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to mark the
        150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only
        specialist batsman of the post–World War II era, along with Viv
        Richards, to get featured in the team. In 2019, he was inducted into the
        ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. On 24 April 2023, the Sydney Cricket Ground
        unveiled a set of gates named after Tendulkar and Brian Lara on the
        occasion of Tendulkar's 50th birthday and the 30th anniversary of Lara's
        innings of 277 at the ground.<br />

        Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April
        1973 to a Maharastrian family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a
        Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked in
        the insurance industry. Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite
        music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three older siblings:
        two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were
        his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her
        third child. His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket
        League.<br />

        Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative
        Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was
        considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new children in his
        school.<br />

        As a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. He
        particularly idolised American player John McEnroe, and emulated his
        hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time,
        Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands and
        carried a tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis.<br />

        To help curb his bullying tendencies, his elder brother Ajit introduced
        Tendulkar to cricket in 1984. Ajit introduced him to cricket coach
        Ramakant Achrekar at Shivaji Park in Dadar. At their first meeting,
        Tendulkar did not play well. Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling
        self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying
        his natural game. Ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at
        playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Tendulkar,
        apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's
        academy.<br />

        Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift
        his schooling[citation needed] to Sharadashram Vidyamandir School, a
        school in Dadar that had produced many notable cricketers. He made his
        debut as a cricketer for Sharadashram in late 1984. Prior to this,
        Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School
        in Bandra (East). He was also coached under the guidance of Achrekar at
        Shivaji Park in the mornings and evenings. Tendulkar would practice for
        hours; if he became exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on
        the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get
        the coin. If Tendulkar completed the session without getting dismissed,
        the coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar considers the 13 coins he
        won among his most prized possessions. While he was training at Shivaji
        Park, he moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near the park.<br />

        Besides school cricket, Tendulkar also played club cricket. In 1984, at
        age 11, he debuted in the Kanga Cricket League while playing for the
        John Bright Cricket Club. Beginning in 1988, he played for the Cricket
        Club of India. In 1988, while playing for Sharadashram, Tendulkar and
        Vinod Kambli batted in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris
        Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School. Tendulkar
        scored 326 (not out) in that match and scored over 1,000 runs in the
        tournament. This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until
        2006, when it was broken by two junior cricketers in Hyderabad,
        India.<br /><br />

      <h2>Yuvraj Singh</h2>

      <p>
        Yuvraj Singh (born 12 December 1981) is a former Indian international
        cricketer who played in all formats of the game. He is an all-rounder
        who batted left-handed in the middle order and bowled slow left-arm
        orthodox . He has won 7 Player of the Series awards in ODI cricket,
        which is joint 3rd highest by an Indian, shared with former Indian
        captain Sourav Ganguly. He is also the son of former Indian fast bowler
        and Punjabi actor Yograj Singh.<br />

        Yuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in One Day Internationals
        (ODIs) between 2000 and 2017 and played his first Test match in October
        2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and
        2008. In a match against England at the 2007 World Twenty20, he famously
        hit six sixes in one over bowled by Stuart Broad a feat performed
        only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in
        an international match between two teams with Test match status. In the
        same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20
        Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls,
        which was a record for fastest half century in International cricket,
        until it was broken by Dipendra Airee during 2023 Asian Games but Singh
        still holds the record in the ICC Cricket World Cup and among ICC full
        member nations. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to
        take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same World Cup match. During
        the 2011 World Cup, Yuvraj Singh played eight innings in nine matches
        and scored 362 runs with a remarkable average of 90.50. He also took 15
        wickets in the tournament, maintaining an economy rate of 5.02.<br />

        In 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his left lung
        and underwent chemotherapy treatment in Boston and Indianapolis. In
        March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the
        third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He
        made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against
        New Zealand shortly before the 2012 World Twenty20.
        <br />
        In 2012, Yuvraj was conferred with the Arjuna Award, India's second
        highest sporting award by the Government of India. In 2014, he was
        awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour. At the
        2014 IPL auction Royal Challengers Bengaluru bought Yuvraj for an
        all-time high price of ₹14 crore and, in 2015, the Delhi Capitals bought
        him for ₹16 crore making him the second most expensive player ever to be
        sold in the IPL until Chris Morris was sold to the Rajasthan Royals for
        a record ₹16.25 crore in February 2021. In February 2014, he was
        honoured with FICCI Most Inspiring Sportsperson of the Year Award.<br />

        On 10 June 2019, Yuvraj announced his retirement from all forms of
        International cricket. He last represented India in June 2017, against
        the West Indies. His request for a return to domestic cricket and IPL
        was turned down by BCCI for participating in Global T20 League in Canada
        and T10 league.<br />
        Yuvraj was selected in the Indian squad for the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy
        on the back of his impressive performances for the Under-19 team. He
        made his international debut against Kenya in the pre-quarterfinal. He
        bowled four overs conceding 16 runs but did not get to bat. In the
        quarterfinal match against Australia, Yuvraj won the man of the match
        for his innings of 84 out of 80 balls, against a pace attack consisting
        of Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, that helped India win
        by 20 runs. In the semifinal against South Africa, he scored 41 and
        picked 1/15. He scored only 18 against New Zealand in the final which
        India lost. The tournament was followed by a tri-series involving India,
        Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Yuvraj scored just 55 runs in five innings at an
        average of 11. Yuvraj averaged 15.50 in the ODI series against the
        touring Zimbabwe side in December 2000 after which he was dropped from
        the team.<br />

        Yuvraj made his comeback during the 2001 Coca-Cola Cup in Sri Lanka. He
        scored a crucial 98* against Sri Lanka in the fifth match of an
        otherwise disappointing series with the bat. However, he proved to be
        useful with the ball as he took 8 wickets at an average of 27. In the
        Standard Bank triangular series involving hosts South Africa, India and
        Kenya, Yuvraj managed to score only 69 runs from 6 innings, including a
        duck in the final against South Africa. Following this, Dinesh Mongia
        and Hemang Badani were chosen over Yuvraj in the squad for the home
        series against England in January 2002.<br />

        Yuvraj returned to domestic cricket in early 2002. After a disappointing
        run in the Ranji knockouts, Yuvraj struck 209 for North Zone against
        South Zone in a Duleep Trophy match in March 2002. He was immediately
        drafted into the national squad for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe
        with India trailing the series 1–2. Yuvraj made an impact in his return
        match at Hyderabad, scoring an unbeaten 80 off just 60 balls, taking
        India to a five-wicket win and levelling the series. He won the Man of
        the Match award for his efforts. In the final ODI at Guvahati, Yuvraj
        made 75 runs from 52 balls, sharing a 157-run fifth-wicket partnership
        with Mongia who scored his career-best unbeaten 159, to help India post
        a total of 333 in their 50 overs. India went on to win the game by 101
        runs and the series 3–2.<br /><br />
